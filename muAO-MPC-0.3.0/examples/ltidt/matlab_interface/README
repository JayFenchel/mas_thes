Matlab Example
--------------

1. Execute the matlab m file main_motor.m

For example, in a matlab console switch to this directory and type:
main_motor

Simulink Example
----------------

The example system "simulink_example.mdl" is included with library and located
in folder "examples/ltidt/matlab_interface". It shows the sample use of
controller. To run the example follow the next steps:

1. Change the current MATLAB folder to "examples/ltidt/matlab_interface".
2. Type "open_simulink_example" in the MATLAB console.
3. Press "Build" button in the block properties window which will appear on the
screen.
4. Run the simulation.

The example includes the functionality of solving the control problem and
prediction of the next state of the plant. The model can operate using
closed-loop and open-loop mode. Also the model shows how to check the speed of
execution on device.
