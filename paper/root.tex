\section{RELATED WORK}

\subsection{Model predictive control}

List some literature with information about model predictive control (MPC).

\subsection{Solving optimization problems}

In literature exist many algorithms which use primal dual methods to solve several optimization problems. Most of them are focused on finding solutions with high accuracy. For application as MPC, the optimization often does not necessarily has to yield such exact solutions. Therefore \cite{c1} describes a primal barrier method focused on getting fast, sufficiently exact solutions of quadratic programs, by making use of the special MPC problem structure. This paper's contribution is manly based on the algorithm in \cite{c1}, which has been extended by some numerical robustness approaches. As already proposed in \cite{c6} we use regularization to have a more robust algorithm  if necessary in combination with iterative refinement to compensate the error of regularization. Similar to \cite{c5} we integrate soft constraints in the Fast MPC algorithm of Boyd and focus particularly on the consequences of losing the exact penalty function guarantee. We extend the algorithm to be able to solve more general optimization problems, especially quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs) and second-order cone programs (SOCPs).\\
We aim to combine the advantages of the existing algorithms to receive fast solutions and use several approaches to strengthen the robustness of the algorithm. As result, we can compare the solutions for several approaches and estimate the influence of them to the algorithm.

\section{PROBLEM STATEMENT}

\subsection{Problem Statement and Algorithm  summary of Fast MPC}

\{Introduce the unchanged problem statement of \cite{c1}\}\\
The control variables $u(t),\dots, u(t+T-1)$ and the predicted states $x(t+1),\dots, x(t+T)$ up to the planning horizon $T$ are rewritten to one optimization variable
\begin{equation*}
  z = (u(t),x(t+1),\dots,u(t+T-1),x(t+T))\in \mathbb{R}^{T(m+n)}.
\end{equation*}
The quadratic program (QP) can be formulated as
\begin{equation}\begin{split}
  \underset{z}{\text{min}}\quad &z^{T}Hz + g^{T}z\\
  \text{s.t.} \quad &Pz \leq h,\quad Cz=b
\end{split}\end{equation}
For the use of an infeasible start primal barrier method a logarithmic barrier function
\begin{equation}
  \phi(z)=\sum_{i=1}^{lT+l_{f}}-\log \left ( h_{i}-p_{i}^Tz \right )
\end{equation}
 is introduced to the cost function to handle the inequality constraints.

\subsection{Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Program}

\{Vorteile von QCQP nennen\}
If linear constraints as bounds for state and control variable are not sufficient it can be necessary to use nonlinear constraints such as quadratic constraints
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:qc}
 z^{T}\Gamma_{i} z+\beta_{i}^{T}z\leq\alpha_{i},\quad i=1, \dots, p
\end{equation}
with positive semidefinite matrices $P_{1},\dots,P_{p} \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ (\cite{c7}).
\subsection{Second-Order Cone Program}

A more general form of optimization problems are second-order cone programs (SOCP). It is possible to formulate a lot of different nonlinear convex optimization problems as SOCP (\cite{c7}). The constraints of dimension $k_{i}$ of such SOCP can be formulated as the following
%:
%\{Description as Cone Definition K:=...\}
%as following 
inequality:
\begin{equation*}
 \left \|A_{i}z+b_{i}  \right \|_{2} \leq c_{i}^{T}z+d_{i}\quad i=1, \dots, q,
\end{equation*}
where $A_{1},\dots,A_{q} \in \mathbb{R}^{(k_{i}-1)\times n}$, $b_{1},\dots,b_{q} \in \mathbb{R}^{k_{i}-1}$, $c_{1},\dots,c_{q} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $d_{1},\dots,d_{q} \in \mathbb{R}$

\subsection{Soft Constraints}

To use the algorithm of \cite{c1} it is necessary that $z$ always strictly satisfies the inequality constraints. If the system is moving near its constraints, it is not guaranteed that in case of disturbances its state $x$ is remaining in the feasible area. To avoid such feasibility problems and to make the algorithm more robust we additionally introduce soft constraints. Subsequently the algorithm can violate some inequality constraints by some additional penalty in the cost function. There are different ways to introduce soft constraints in an optimization algorithm. \cite{c5} proposes a method tailored for the algorithm we use without any typically needed additional slack variable and compares the solutions with the typical procedure. Its method comes along the loss of the exact penalty formulation, what makes it possible that the solution is not necessarily the same as in the unmodified case although there is a feasible point that satisfies the constraints.\\
We now want to focus on the consequences of the loss of the exact penalty formulation.
\section{EXTENDED ALGORITHM}

\subsection{Generalized Constraints}

In the described primal barrier method the gradient and the Hessian of the logarithmic barrier function are necessary. SOCCs in the above mentioned form are not continuously differentiable. Therefore SOCCs in Generalized form \cite{c2}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:gen_socc}
 \left \|A_{i}z+b_{i}  \right \|_{2}^2 \leq \left (c_{i}^{T}z+d_{i}  \right )^{2}\quad i=1, \dots, q
\end{equation}
can be used.

\subsection{Extended Problem Statement}

The algorithm of \cite{c1} shell still be used, therefore the general form of the extended problem statement is not changed. We can resolve the norm in (\ref{eq:gen_socc}) and reorder the terms to
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:socc}
  \left  [-\left( c_{i}^{T}z +2d_{i} \right )c_{i}^{T}+\left ( z^{T}A_{i}^{T}+2b_{i}^{T} \right )A_{i}  \right ]z\leq d_{i}^{2}-b_{i}^{T}b_{i}
\end{equation}
Only the constant matrix $P$ and the vector $h$, also constant with respect to the optimization variable $z$, are expanded with $p$ rows belonging to the $p$ new quadratic constraints (\ref{eq:qc}) and $q$ rows for the conic constraints (\ref{eq:socc}) to
\begin{equation*}
	\hat{P}(z)=\begin{bmatrix} P\\ \beta_{1}^{T}+z^{T}\Gamma_{1}\\ \vdots\\ \beta_{p}^{T}+z^{T}\Gamma_{p}\\
	-\left( c_{1}^{T}z +2d_{1} \right )c_{1}^{T}+\left ( z^{T}A_{1}^{T}+2b_{1}^{T} \right )A_{1}\\
	\vdots\\
	-\left( c_{q}^{T}z +2d_{q} \right )c_{q}^{T}+\left ( z^{T}A_{q}^{T}+2b_{q}^{T} \right )A_{q}
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
	\hat{h} = \begin{bmatrix} h\\ \alpha_{1}^{T}\\ \vdots\\ \alpha_{p}^{T}\\d_{1}^{2}-b_{1}^{T}b_{1}\\\vdots\\d_{q}^{2}-b_{q}^{T}b_{q}\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation*}
Different from the extended vector $\hat{h}$, the extended matrix $\hat{P}(z)$ is not constant with respect to $z$ anymore. Despite the dependency on $z$, expanding $P$ and $h$ does not change the structure of $\Phi$ exploited in \cite{c1}. Consequently we can still use the algorithm to solve the QCQP or SOCP. With the new inequality constraint $\hat{P}(z)z \leq \hat{h}$ the logarithmic barrier function looks like
\begin{equation}
	\phi(z)=\sum_{i=1}^{lT+l_{f}+p+q}-\log \left ( \hat{h}_{i}-\hat{p}_{i}^T(z)z \right )
\end{equation}
where $\hat{p}_{i}^T(z)$ is the $i$th rows of $\hat{P}(z)$ depending on $z$. The gradient of the logarithmic barrier function $\nabla\phi(z)$  is necessary to calculate the residual $r$. Because of the first order derivatives of the functions associated with the inequality constraints
\begin{equation}
  \nabla f_{i}\left (z  \right )=\beta_{i}^{T}+2z^{T}\Gamma_{i}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation*}
  \nabla f_{i}\left (z  \right )=\left (2\left(-\left(c_{i}^{T}z + d_{i}\right )c_{i} + \left(z^{T}A_{i}^{T} + b_{i}z^{T} \right )A_{i}\right) \right),
\end{equation*}
the gradient of the logarithmic barrier function is simply derived by forming $\hat{P}$ with argument $2z$ multiplied by $\hat{d}$.
\begin{equation}
	\nabla\phi(z)=\hat{P}^T(2z)\hat{d}
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
	\hat{d}_i=\frac{1}{\hat{h}_{i}-\hat{p}_{i}^T(z)z}
\end{equation}
The second order derivatives of the functions associated with the inequality constraints are
\begin{equation}
 \nabla^{2} f_{i}\left (z  \right )=2\Gamma_{i}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
  \nabla^{2} f_{i}\left (z  \right )= -2 \left( c_{i}c_{i}^{T} - A_{i}^{T} A_{i}  \right),
\end{equation}
of which we obtain two additional terms, that have to be added to the Hessian of $\phi(z)$
\begin{equation}\begin{split}
	\nabla^{2}\phi(z)=&\hat{P}(2z)\text{diag}(\hat{d})^{2}\hat{P}(2z)\\
	&+\sum_{i=lT+lf+1}^{lT+lf+p}\left (2\hat{d}_{i}\Gamma_{i}  \right )\\
	&+\sum_{j=lT+lf+p+1}^{lT+lf+p+q}\left (-2\hat{d}_{j} \left( c_{j}c_{j}^{T} - A_{j}^{T} A_{j}  \right)  \right ),
\end{split}\end{equation}
to form $\Phi$ in the resulting system of linear equations.

\subsection{Selecting $\kappa$}

In \cite{c1} the use of a fixed $\kappa$ is proposed. But it is difficult to find a single $\kappa$ which provides fast convergence of the algorithm against the optimal solution for all feasible states of a controlled system. It should be considered to calculate a new $\kappa$ once in every time step of the MPC. To have the effect of the barrier function term to the whole cost function in the same magnitude as the effect of the weighting terms, we can calculate $\kappa$ similar as in \cite{c4} for linear programs. Several tests have shown that a good $\kappa$ can be estimated by adopting the suggested procedure of \cite{c4} for quadratic programs as 
\begin{equation*}
  \kappa=\frac{z^{T}Hz + g^{T}z}{T(n+m)}
\end{equation*}

                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
\subsection{Regularization}

The most important step to solve the system of linear equations is to compute the Cholesky factorization of every block in $\Phi$. For Cholesky factorization the blocks have to be symmetric and positive definite (\cite{c2}). In Order to have all blocks positive definite and so ensure the Cholesky factorization of every block in $\Phi$ exists, we introduce a regularization term in the system of linear equations. We now solve
\begin{equation}
  \begin{bmatrix} \Phi+\epsilon I & C^{T} \\ C & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}\Delta z \\ \Delta v\end{bmatrix}= -\begin{bmatrix}r_d \\ r_p\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
and tolerate a small error we make instead of solving the original system of linear equations.

\subsection{Iterative Refinement}

For solving the optimization problem as application of a MPC, it is often sufficient to use the solution of the linear equations with regularization term. If it is necessary to get the solution of the original linear equations we can compensate the error of regularization by iterative refinement as described in \cite{c6}. Let
\begin{equation*}
  K l = r
\end{equation*}
the original system of linear equations and
\begin{equation*}
  \tilde{K}l^{(0)} = r
\end{equation*}
the system with regularization we can solve easily. Setting $k=0$ a correction $\delta l^{(k)}$ can be approximated by solving
\begin{equation*}
  \tilde{K}\delta l^{(k)} = \left(r-Kl^{(k)} \right),
\end{equation*}
which takes less effort because we already calculated the operator $\tilde{K}^{-1}$ before. Then one has to update
\begin{equation*}
  l^{(k+1)} = l^{(k)}+\delta l^{(k)}
\end{equation*}
and iterate $k$. After repeating both steps until
\begin{equation*}
  \left\|r-Kl^{(k)} \right\|
\end{equation*}
is sufficiently small, $l^{(k)}$ can be used as good approximation for $l$.
