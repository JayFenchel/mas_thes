\section{INTRODUCTION}

Write the introduction here.

\section{RELATED WORK}

\subsection{Model predictive control}

List some papers sharing information about model predictive control.

\subsection{Solving optimization problems}

Mainly introduce [Fast Model Predictive Control Using Online Optimization by Wang and Boyd] and where some usefull features expending its algorithm are discribed. \cite{c1}

\section{PROBLEM STATEMENT}

\subsection{Description of a Quadratic Program}

Introduce the unchanged problem statement of \cite{c1}

\subsection{Quadratic Constrained Quadratic Program}
If linear constraints as bounds for state and control variable are not sufficient it can be necessary to use nonlinear constraints such as quadratic constraints.
\begin{equation}
 z^{T}\Gamma z+\beta^{T}z\leq\alpha
\end{equation}

\subsection{Second Order Cone Program}
A more gernal form of contraints are second order cone constraints. An Optimization problem using this type of constraints is called second order cone program. Constraints are described as a second order cone as following:
\{Description as Cone Definition K:=...\}
as following inequality:
\begin{equation}
 \left \|Az+b  \right \|_{2} \leq c^{T}z+d
\end{equation}

\subsection{Soft Constraints}

\section{EXTENDED ALGORITHM}

\subsection{Generalized Constraints}
In the descirbed primal barrier first and second order derivative. A SOCC in the above mentioned form is not continuously differentiable. Therefor SOCC in Generalized form \cite{c2} can be used.
\begin{equation}
 \left \|Az+b  \right \|_{2}^2 \leq \left (c^{T}z+d  \right )^{2}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Extended Problem Statement}
The algorithm of \cite{c1} shell still be used, therefor its genreal form is not changed. Only the constant matrix P and the vector h, also constant regardingly the optimizationvariable z, are expended with $p$ rows belonging to the $p$ new quadratic constraints und $q$ rows for the conic constraints. Different from the extended vector $\hat{h}$ the extended matrix $\hat{P}(z)$ is not constant regardingly z anymore.
\begin{equation}
	\hat{P}(z)=\begin{bmatrix} P\\ \beta_{1}^{T}+z^{T}\Gamma_{1}\\ \vdots\\ \beta_{p}^{T}+z^{T}\Gamma_{p}\\
	-\left( c_{1}^{T}z +2d_{1} \right )c_{1}^{T}+\left ( z^{T}A_{1}^{T}+2b_{1}^{T} \right )A_{1}\\
	\vdots\\
	-\left( c_{q}^{T}z +2d_{q} \right )c_{q}^{T}+\left ( z^{T}A_{q}^{T}+2b_{q}^{T} \right )A_{q}
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\hat{h} = \begin{bmatrix} h\\ \alpha_{1}^{T}\\ \vdots\\ \alpha_{p}^{T}\\d_{1}^{2}-b_{1}^{T}b_{1}\\\vdots\\d_{q}^{2}-b_{q}^{T}b_{q}\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
Expending $P$ and $h$ does not change the structure of $\Phi$ exploited in \cite{c1}. So we have not to worry go on with its algorithm. With new $\hat{h}$ and $\hat{P}(z)$ the logarithmic barrier function looks like
\begin{equation}
	\phi(z)=\sum_{i=1}^{lT+l_{f}+p+q}-\log \left ( \hat{h}_{i}-\hat{p}_{i}^T(z)z \right )
\end{equation}
where $\hat{p}_{i}^T(z)$ is the $i$th rows of $\hat{P}(z)$ depending on $z$. The gradient of the logarithmic barrier function $\nabla\phi(z)$ necessary to calculate the residual is derived simply bei forming $\hat{P}$ with argument $2z$ multiplied by $\hat{d}$.
\begin{equation}
	\nabla\phi(z)=\hat{P}^T(2z)\hat{d}
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
	\hat{d}_i=\frac{1}{\hat{h}_{i}-\hat{p}_{i}^T(z)z}
\end{equation}
To obtain $\Phi$ in the resulting system of linear equations two additionel terms have to be added to the Hessian of $\phi(z)$.
\begin{equation}\begin{split}
	\nabla^{2}\phi(z)=&\hat{P}(2z)\text{diag}(\hat{d})^{2}\hat{P}(2z)\\
	&+\sum_{i=lT+lf+1}^{lT+lf+p}\left (\hat{d}_{i}2\Gamma_{i}  \right )\\
	&+\sum_{j=lT+lf+p+1}^{lT+lf+p+q}\left (\hat{d}_{j}-2 \left( c_{j}c_{j}^{T} - A_{j}^{T} A_{j}  \right)  \right )
\end{split}\end{equation}

\subsection{Selecting $\kappa$}
In \cite{c1} the use of a fixed kappa is proposed. But it is difficult to find one. Eventually it should be considered to calculate a new $\kappa$ once every time step, not every inner step, proportional to the values in the optimization variable like in [guck nach] for linear programs. Adopted for quadratic programs $\kappa$ can be estimated as follows

\section{CONCLUSIONS}

\addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
